  Enable when your BSP will be running in a slave mode. Such BSP does not initialize any
  peripherals but rely purely on firmware/BSP running on another CPU core. The communication
  between both BSPs/cores is done using shared memory regions and only master BSP is allowed
  to touch/use peripherals.
